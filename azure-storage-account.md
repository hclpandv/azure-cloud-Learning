## Azure Storage Account

An Azure storage account contains all of your Azure Storage data objects: blobs, files, queues, tables, and disks. The storage account provides a unique namespace for your Azure Storage data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. Data in your Azure storage account is durable and highly available, secure, and massively scalable.

> Even when you login to the Azure portal for the first time and try to access azure cloud shell, Azure asks you to must create a storage account so that your user data on azure cloud shell can be mapped to a storage for persistance i.e. a file share
